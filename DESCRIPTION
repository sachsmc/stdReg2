Description: Contains more modern tools for causal inference using regression 
      standardization. Four general classes of models are allowed; generalized 
      linear models, conditional generalized estimating equation models, 
      Cox proportional hazards models and shared frailty gamma-Weibull models. 
      Sjolander, A. (2016) <doi:10.1007/s10654-016-0157-3>. Also includes functionality
      for doubly robust estimation for these model classes in some special cases.
