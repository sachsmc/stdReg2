Description: Contains more modern tools for causal inference using regression 
      standardization. Four general classes of models are implemented; generalized 
      linear models, conditional generalized estimating equation models, 
      Cox proportional hazards models, and shared frailty gamma-Weibull models. 
      Methodological details are described in Sjölander, A. (2016) <doi:10.1007/s10654-016-0157-3>. 
      Also includes functionality for doubly robust estimation for generalized linear models 
      in some special cases, and the ability to implement custom models.
