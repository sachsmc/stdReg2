\title{Regression standardization in Cox proportional hazards models}
\usage{
standardize_coxph(formula, data, values, times, clusterid)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula for the
\code{coxph} function in the \pkg{survival} package, but without special
terms \code{strata}, \code{cluster} or \code{tt}.  Only \code{breslow}
method for handling ties is allowed.}

\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables in the model. This should
be the same data frame as was used to fit the model in \code{fit}.}

\item{values}{A named list or data.frame specifying the variables and values
at which marginal means of the outcome will be estimated.}

\item{times}{an optional vector containing the specific values of \eqn{T} at
which to estimate the standardized survival function. It defaults to all the
observed event times in \code{data}.}

\item{clusterid}{an optional string containing the name of a cluster
identification variable when data are clustered.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"std_coxph"} is a list containing
\item{call}{ the matched call.  } \item{input}{ \code{input} is a list
containing all input arguments.  } \item{est}{ a matrix with
\code{length(t)} rows and \code{length(x)} columns, where the element on row
\code{i} and column \code{j} is equal to
\eqn{\hat{\theta}}(\code{t[i],x[j]}).  } \item{vcov}{ a list with
\code{length(t)} elements. Each element is a square matrix with
\code{length(x)} rows. In the \code{k:th} matrix, the element on row
\code{i} and column \code{j} is the (estimated) covariance of
\eqn{\hat{\theta}}(\code{t[k]},\code{x[i]}) and
\eqn{\hat{\theta}}(\code{t[k]},\code{x[j]}).  }

\description{
\code{standardize_coxph} performs regression standardization in Cox proportional
hazards models, at specified values of the exposure, over the sample
covariate distribution. Let \eqn{T}, \eqn{X}, and \eqn{Z} be the survival
outcome, the exposure, and a vector of covariates, respectively.
\code{standardize_coxph} uses a fitted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the
standardized survival function \eqn{\theta(t,x)=E\{S(t|X=x,Z)\}}, where
\eqn{t} is a specific value of \eqn{T}, \eqn{x} is a specific value of
\eqn{X}, and the expectation is over the marginal distribution of \eqn{Z}.
}
\details{
\code{standardize_coxph} assumes that a Cox proportional hazards model
\deqn{\lambda(t|X,Z)=\lambda_0(t)exp\{h(X,Z;\beta)\}} has been fitted.
Breslow's estimator of the cumulative baseline hazard
\eqn{\Lambda_0(t)=\int_0^t\lambda_0(u)du} is used together with the partial
likelihood estimate of \eqn{\beta} to obtain estimates of the survival
function \eqn{S(t|X=x,Z)}:
\deqn{\hat{S}(t|X=x,Z)=exp[-\hat{\Lambda}_0(t)exp\{h(X=x,Z;\hat{\beta})\}].}
For each \eqn{t} in the \code{t} argument and for each \eqn{x} in the
\code{x} argument, these estimates are averaged across all subjects (i.e.
all observed values of \eqn{Z}) to produce estimates
\deqn{\hat{\theta}(t,x)=\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{S}(t|X=x,Z_i)/n,} where \eqn{Z_i}
is the value of \eqn{Z} for subject \eqn{i}, \eqn{i=1,...,n}.  The variance
for \eqn{\hat{\theta}(t,x)} is obtained by the sandwich formula.
}
\note{
Standardized survival functions are sometimes referred to as (direct)
adjusted survival functions in the literature.

\code{standardize_coxph} does not currently handle time-varying exposures or
covariates.

\code{standardize_coxph} internally loops over all values in the \code{t} argument.
Therefore, the function will usually be considerably faster if
\code{length(t)} is small.

The variance calculation performed by \code{standardize_coxph} does not condition on
the observed covariates \eqn{\bar{Z}=(Z_1,...,Z_n)}. To see how this
matters, note that
\deqn{var\{\hat{\theta}(t,x)\}=E[var\{\hat{\theta}(t,x)|\bar{Z}\}]+var[E\{\hat{\theta}(t,x)|\bar{Z}\}].}
The usual parameter \eqn{\beta} in a Cox proportional hazards model does not
depend on \eqn{\bar{Z}}. Thus, \eqn{E(\hat{\beta}|\bar{Z})} is independent
of \eqn{\bar{Z}} as well (since \eqn{E(\hat{\beta}|\bar{Z})=\beta}), so that
the term \eqn{var[E\{\hat{\beta}|\bar{Z}\}]} in the corresponding variance
decomposition for \eqn{var(\hat{\beta})} becomes equal to 0. However,
\eqn{\theta(t,x)} depends on \eqn{\bar{Z}} through the average over the
sample distribution for \eqn{Z}, and thus the term
\eqn{var[E\{\hat{\theta}(t,x)|\bar{Z}\}]} is not 0, unless one conditions on
\eqn{\bar{Z}}. The variance calculation by Gail and Byar (1986) ignores this
term, and thus effectively conditions on \eqn{\bar{Z}}.
